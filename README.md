Sign Language Conversion Using Deep Learning

Sign language conversion is a transformative field in artificial intelligence that focuses on interpreting and translating sign language gestures into text or speech automatically. In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately recognize and convert hand signs representing the alphabet (A-Z).

Key Components:

Dataset: We created a custom dataset of hand sign images representing the English alphabet (A-Z) and a blank gesture for training and evaluation purposes.

Model Architecture: The deep learning model employs a CNN architecture consisting of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers, dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and fully connected layers for gesture classification.

Training: The model is trained on labeled hand sign images using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, allowing it to learn and differentiate between various signs.

Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate testing dataset, and its performance is measured through accuracy and other relevant metrics to ensure its effectiveness in recognizing different sign language gestures.

Conversion: Once trained, the model can predict and convert new hand sign images into corresponding text, providing a bridge between sign language and text-based communication.

Usage:

Users can capture hand sign images using a webcam, which the trained model will then interpret and convert into text in real time. This technology can be applied in various fields, including enhancing communication for the hearing impaired, supporting education tools for learning sign language, and enabling accessible interfaces in smart devices.

Conclusion:

Sign language conversion using deep learning opens up new possibilities for accessible communication and interaction. This project serves as a foundation for developing and implementing effective sign language recognition and conversion systems using state-of-the-art deep learning methods.
